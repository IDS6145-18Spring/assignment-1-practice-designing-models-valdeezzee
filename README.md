## General Introduction

A **smart city** is an urban area that uses different types of electronic data collection sensors to supply information which is used to manage assets and resources efficiently.

It is always a hassle trying to find parking, espcially in a busy part of town. Whether you are going to an event, school or an appointment, finding parking is frustrating. Not only that, but you are wasting time, driving around searching, and using up fuel at the same time. For example, going to class on a busy day, which is most days, you are driving around following people in hopes they are leaving for the day. Typically I can spend 10 - 15 minutes looking. This also increases traffic around the area where parking is hard to find.

The problem originates from growing populations and tourism. There are a couple parking sites and apps that just let you know where there is parking but not exactly if there is parking.

There is this app but it has not been updated since 2012 and it only lets the user know of a parking garage in the downtown area

## Requirements (Experimental Design)

Hypothesis - Having a smart parking system can decrese the time it takes to find a parking, traffic, and the use of fuel. 

Requirements:

There will be senors that are placed in the ground on the center of the desired parking spot. This sensor will have detection whether there is a vehicle park or not. It will be used to send information to the app that will update the parking spot in real time. It will also have geolocation to send the exact spot found.

The User will be able to set route to spot and it will store that time it takes to arrive at the spot. This data will be collected to find better ways to address parking. Nearby traffic sensors will be able to identify.

## Smart City Fast Parking Search Simulation

I would have a user input their location or the location where they would like to search for parking. The simulation searches for the closest parking lot and shows the parking spots in the lot you pick.
