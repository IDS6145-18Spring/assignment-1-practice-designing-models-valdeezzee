## Smart City Fast Parking Search Simulation

For the Fast Parking Search system I chose to use a Discrete-Event Based Simulation.

I chose this because a Discrete-Event Based Simulation changes it's behavior only when it is responding to a specific event. In this case a user input or a vehicle when it is parked over a sensor.

I would conduct the simulation with Anylogic because it is easy to use and has many resourses to get the results I want.

Some of the data I would like to collect is: 

- time it take to reach parking spot
- availablity of a parking spot
- traffic data around area of parkings

(remove: images say 1000 words for you...)
